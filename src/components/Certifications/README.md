## Data Structure

### Certification Interface

```typescript
export interface Certification {
  id: string; // Unique identifier
  title: string; // Certification name
  description: string; // Detailed description
  image: string; // Certification/institution image
  status: "completed" | "in-progress"; // Current status
  institution?: string; // Issuing institution
  completionDate?: string; // Date completed (if applicable)
  certUrl?: string; // Certificate URL (if completed)
  skills?: string[]; // Technologies/skills covered
}
```

### Example Certification Entry

```typescript
{
  id: "devops",
  title: "DevOps",
  description: "Currently progressing through a comprehensive DevOps program where I'm mastering CI/CD implementation, Git version control, and infrastructure automation using IaC tools with integrated security practices. Developing expertise in Kubernetes for containerized application orchestration and implementing monitoring solutions with Prometheus and Grafana for observability, with additional modules still to complete.",
  image: "/images/projects/imgTecmilenio.webp",
  status: "in-progress",
  institution: "Universidad TecMilenio",
  skills: [
    "CI/CD",
    "Kubernetes",
    "Docker",
    "Prometheus",
    "Grafana",
    "Infrastructure as Code"
  ]
}
```

## Adding New Certifications

### Step 1: Add Certification Data

Open `src/components/Certifications/certificationsData.ts` and add your new certification to the array:

```typescript
export const certificationsData: Certification[] = [
  // ...existing certifications...
  {
    id: "your-cert-id",
    title: "Your Certification Name",
    description:
      "Detailed description of what you learned, skills acquired, and current progress. Include specific technologies, methodologies, and practical applications.",
    image: "/images/projects/your-cert-image.webp",
    status: "completed", // or "in-progress"
    institution: "Institution Name",
    completionDate: "March 2024", // Only for completed certifications
    certUrl: "https://your-certificate-url.com", // Only for completed certifications
    skills: ["Skill 1", "Skill 2", "Technology 1", "Framework 1"],
  },
];
```

### Step 2: Add Certification Image

1. Add your certification or institution image to `/public/images/projects/`
2. Use WebP format for optimal performance
3. Recommended size: 400x300px or similar aspect ratio
4. Update the `image` path in your certification data

### Step 3: Verify Display

The certification will automatically appear in the grid. Check:

- ✅ Card displays properly in the grid
- ✅ Status indicator shows correctly
- ✅ Modal opens with all information
- ✅ Skills tags display properly
- ✅ Institution name appears correctly

## Customization Options

### Status Types

The system supports two status types:

```typescript
// For completed certifications
status: "completed";
// Shows green indicator, includes completion date and certificate URL

// For ongoing certifications
status: "in-progress";
// Shows yellow indicator, no completion date or certificate URL
```

### Modal Styling

The certification modal uses consistent purple/pink/indigo theming:

- **Border**: `border-purple-400/40`
- **Shadow**: `shadow-purple-500/30`
- **Gradients**: `from-purple-400 via-pink-400 to-indigo-500`
- **Accent Colors**: Purple, Pink, and Indigo variants

### Grid Layout

The responsive grid automatically adjusts:

- **Mobile**: 1 column
- **Tablet**: 2 columns
- **Desktop**: 3 columns

## Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (sm and below)

- Single column layout
- Larger touch targets
- Simplified modal layout
- Condensed spacing

### Tablet (md)

- Two column grid
- Optimized card sizes
- Touch-friendly interactions

### Desktop (lg and up)

- Three column grid
- Hover effects enabled
- Full modal layout
- Enhanced visual effects

## Accessibility Features

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with focus indicators
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Focus Management**: Modal traps focus and restores on close
- **High Contrast**: Sufficient color contrast ratios
- **Status Indicators**: Both visual and text-based status communication

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Certification images use `loading="lazy"`
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format for optimal file sizes
- **CSS Animations**: Hardware-accelerated transforms
- **Component Splitting**: Modular architecture for code splitting
- **Event Delegation**: Efficient event handling

## Testing Your Changes

After adding a new certification:

1. **Visual Check**: Verify the image displays correctly
2. **Status Display**: Confirm the status indicator is appropriate
3. **Modal Content**: Check all sections populate properly
4. **Skills Display**: Ensure skills tags render correctly
5. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile and desktop
6. **Accessibility**: Test keyboard navigation

## Troubleshooting

### Image Not Displaying

- Check file path in `image` property
- Verify image exists in `/public/images/projects/`
- Ensure WebP format is supported

### Status Indicator Issues

- Verify `status` is exactly "completed" or "in-progress"
- Check for typos in status value
- Ensure status styling classes are properly applied

### Modal Content Missing

- Ensure all required properties are included
- Check for typos in property names
- Verify arrays have content
- For completed certs, include `completionDate` and `certUrl`

### Skills Not Displaying

- Ensure `skills` is an array of strings
- Check for proper array syntax
- Verify skills contain meaningful technology/skill names

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Maintain consistent indentation
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep descriptions informative but concise

## Best Practices

### Writing Descriptions

- Be specific about skills and technologies learned
- Include practical applications and projects completed
- Mention ongoing progress for in-progress certifications
- Use active voice and present/past tense appropriately

### Choosing Images

- Use official institution logos when available
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios
- Optimize images for web (WebP format)
- Ensure images are high quality but reasonably sized

### Skills Selection

- Include relevant technologies and frameworks
- Focus on practical, applicable skills
- Use standard technology names
- Limit to 4-8 most important skills per certification
